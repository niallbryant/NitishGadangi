### A Community-driven platform which fills the gap between the Plasma Donors and Patients who are in requirement of plasma.

COVID-19 has been here all across the globe since the past 7 months. From less than a million cases in February, and currently has more than 10 million cases across the globe. With a vaccine still a long way away, plasma therapy has been developed as an experimental cure for COVID. Plasma therapy has been helping a lot of families recover their loved ones from COVID. 

However, because of the absence of a common medium or a platform which helps patients to find Plasma Donors, Many lives are getting stuck in Risk. That's where the idea of Find Plasma App came into existence.

Find Plasma App is a small step towards solving the problem of finding eligible donors in a situation where time is of great essence. Users can quickly open the app to find all the eligible donors nearby. All required health and contact details will be available in the app. Also, there is a provision to find Patients who are currently in need of plasma.
One can easily self-register as Donor or as a patient, by quickly filling a small form where one need to specify details about contact info and heath info.
Also, there is a page containing list of all FAQs, so that users can understand the need for donating the plasma.

This way by establishing a common platform to find a Plasma Donor. We sincerely hope you or your loved ones never have to go through this ordeal. But if you do, then we aspire to be able to help you by connecting you with volunteer donors.

**Every Donor is a Life Savior. So Donate Blood, Save Lives!**
